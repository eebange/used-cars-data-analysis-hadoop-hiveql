# CarGurus Data Analysis Project - Intro to Big Data CIS 4560

# Project Overview
We will use a dataset downloaded from Kaggle, which contains data from CarGurus, an online used car marketplace. Our projects objective is the analysis of sale trends based on specific vehicle features within a limnited time range.

[**Background from Kaggle User:**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset?resource=download)

The dataset contains 3 million real world used cars details.
This data was obtained by running a self made crawler on Cargurus inventory in September 2020.
This data is for academic, research and individual experimentation only and is not intended for commercial purposes.
Imagine a web app that can estimate the listing price of a vehicle. What features of the vehicle should be used to build a price prediction regression model?
